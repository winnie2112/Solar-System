                <figcaption>Sunspots are cooler regions on the Sun caused by a concentration of magnetic field lines.<br>
                    They appear dark because they are cooler than the surrounding areas of the Sun's surface.<br>
                    Sunspots are often associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can affect space weather and technology on Earth.<br>
                    The Sun has an 11-year cycle of solar activity, with periods of high and low sunspot numbers.

                <figcaption>The Sun runs by nuclear fusion, where hydrogen fuses to form helium in the Sun's core, held together by its own gravity.<br>
                    The material leaving the corona at supersonic speeds becomes the solar wind.
                    The Sun photosphere doesnâ€™t have a solid surface like other rocky planets and moons.
                    Photosphere is the first layer of the solar atmosphere. It's about 250 miles thick, with temperatures reaching about 5,500Â°C

                  The Parker Solar Probe is the first spacecraft to fly into the Sun's atmosphere, or corona.<br>
                  It will help scientists understand how solar activity affects space weather and technology on Earth.<br>
                  The probe will make several close passes of the Sun, gathering data about its magnetic fields and solar winds.
